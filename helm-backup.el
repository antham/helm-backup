;;; Commentary:

;; To store change every time you save a file add :
;; (add-hook 'after-save-hook 'helm-backup-versioning)
;; or from Emacs you can do :
;; M-x customize-variable RET after-save-hook RET [INS] helm-backup-versioning

;; To retrieve file backup, from buffer call `helm-backup' :
;; M-x helm-backup
;; for convenience you can define key binding as follow :
;; (global-set-key (kbd "C-c b") 'helm-backup)
